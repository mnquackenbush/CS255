Repository for SNHU Class CS-255 (System Analysis and Design)

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a practice case to simulate the Systems Analysis and Design process. In the project, the business (DriverPass) was looking for
a system to be built that would allow new drivers to purchase Driver's Ed training modules and book driving instructions with drivers that were licensed through
the business. The system would also allow the driver's to directly provide feedback to their students after their lessons.

What did you do particularly well?

I felt I did a particularly good job of analyzing the provided interview document and determining the various technical and non-technical requirements that the 
system would need from the provided information.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would spend a bit more time touching up the various UML diagrams that I created for the course. Because these visual models are often used to explain the 
system to non-technical stakeholders, the diagrams should provide a robust demonstration of the system's design, while also being succint enough for an average
viewer to understand at a glance. I feel I could've made my diagrams a bit easier to understand for a non-technical audeince.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Much of my understanding of the user's needs came from the DriverPass Interview transcript that was provided to gather design requirements. This involved the
CEO / Owner of the company and the head of IT for the company laying out what they would need the DriverPass system to do. Having the owner explicitly express
the kind of functionality he'd like for his company's system provided a clear understanding of the kind of software that would need to be developed over the course
of the project. As the system will be ultimately utilized by not only the administrators in the backend, but also the students and drivers that will have access to the
system, it's important to maintain a complex understanding of how different users will make use of the system in order to meet each of their expectations. This not
only helps to inform what the system needs to do, but how the system should be implemented so that the interface is easily understood by anyone using it.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

As stated above, I think when designing software for a client / end user, it is extremely important to keep the user's needs in the front of your mind
at all times. Adding extraneous features that users have no desire for (no matter how well intentioned) often makes the end product overly complicated
and eats up the time and resources of a development team, that could be better focused on meeting the desires of the product's users. This is largely why
I find Agile development systems to be the most beneficial in software development, as they allow for quick turnaround times to incorporate user feedback
and realign a project's goals to better meet those expectations in future sprints.
